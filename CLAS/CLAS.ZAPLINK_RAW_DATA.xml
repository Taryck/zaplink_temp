ASThis abstract object define is the entry point of inheritance for each
  type dependent datas. Data for program (PROG) is completely different
  from data for type pool. All data displayed in XML inherit from this
  object allowing you to browse all supported type.
ASIt also introduce the common concept of &quot;dependencies&quot; which list all
  component that must be present before loading this component. This is
  not the list of component that must be compiled before being able to
  compile this component, but the list of component that will prevent this
  component to load correctly if they are missing.
AS
ASAs example : If you try to load a connector before connector&apos;s interface
  is loaded, you will get a short dump because your connector was unable
  to create correctly any method that are redefinitions from an interface
  that weren&apos;t exists.
